# Unfluffify Plan

## Marking Logic Rewrite

First pass:

1. Restore b9 marking semantics for target selection and pure rules.
2. Remove stale default-boundary promotion behavior that turned plain exclude clicks into explicit includes.
3. Refresh marking docs, tests, and knowledge notes to match the restored rule set.
4. Run focused marking/submission/silent-highlight tests, then commit and push.

Post-run pass:

1. Re-run the broader suite after the first pass lands.
2. Fix only indirect regressions that are adjacent to marking/highlighting, such as stale silent-highlight presentation or documentation assertions.
3. Leave unrelated remote-support, telemetry, and theme-color failures for a separate follow-up unless they block the marking/highlighting checks.
4. Commit and push the final cleanup separately.

## Remote Support Follow-up

1. Validate Chrome-window display sharing and camera/microphone permission prompts in two real Chrome profiles.
2. Verify view-only supporter sessions keep supportee marking, highlighting, popup, and sidebar workflows usable.
3. Continue improving remote cursor/sidebar presence as observational metadata only, without reintroducing remote-control command replay.
4. Validate DevTools console/network mirroring labels for page content script, popup.html, and background worker contexts with and without optional payloads.
5. Run manual two-profile validation for navigation, sidebar sync, telemetry, camera/microphone, and teardown after substantial remote-support changes.

## Constraints

- Do not reintroduce supporter remote-control or control handoff/takeover paths.
- Fail remote-support bootstrap when valid ICE config is missing; do not silently fall back away from the Cloudflare-only contract.
